In a lackluster tale of mundane misadventures set against the backdrop of an uninspired suburban landscape, a predictably unremarkable protagonist stumbles through a series of contrived and clich√©d scenarios, delivering stilted dialogue with all the emotional depth of a cardboard cutout, while the supporting cast valiantly attempts to inject life into a plot so trite and derivative that even the most forgiving of audiences would find it impossible to muster any genuine engagement or interest, resulting in a cinematic experience that, despite the earnest efforts of the production team, ultimately amounts to nothing more than a forgettable exercise in mediocrity, deserving of no accolades, let alone the illustrious honor of an Oscar.
